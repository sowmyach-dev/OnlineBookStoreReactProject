# Features
## Book Browsing:

1. Users can view books in either grid or list view modes.
2. Books are fetched dynamically from the Google Books API.
3. Pagination is available if the book list exceeds a certain number.

## Search Functionality:

1. A search bar is provided to search for books by title, author, or genre.
2. Search results are displayed dynamically as the user types.

### Book Details:

1. Users can click on any book to view more detailed information.
2. Book details include title, author, genre, and description.


### Shopping Cart:

1. Users can add books to their shopping cart.
2. The cart displays the selected books with an option to remove them.
3. The cart is persistent throughout the session.

### Checkout:

## Additional Notes
### Styling:

The application is styled using CSS, with a focus on a clean and responsive design. The NavBar is fixed at the top of the screen, and the buttons are styled for better visual appeal.

### API Integration:

The project uses the Google Books API to fetch book data. Ensure you have an API key set up and correctly configured in your project.

### Error Handling:

Basic error handling is implemented, including handling network errors and displaying appropriate messages to the user.

### Performance Considerations:

For production, consider optimizing images and minimizing JavaScript/CSS to improve load times.

## Potential Enhancements
### User Authentication:

Implement user login and registration to allow users to save their carts and view order history.

### Improved Search:

Add filters and advanced search options to refine search results further.

### Backend Integration:

Integrate with a backend service to manage inventory, process real payments, and track user orders.

### Testing:

Implement unit and integration tests to ensure application reliability and catch bugs early.
